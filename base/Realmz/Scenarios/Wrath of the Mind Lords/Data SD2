That non-gifted peoples used to live free.  But such a mythical age ended centuries ago.  ˙Freedom, the whispered stories say, ended with the Second Rising of the God-like Mentarchs, those supreme rulers of the Lankharhan people whom you know better as 'Mind Lords'. The Mentarchs had been banished thousands of winters ago, the stories say.     ˛But their leader, the Hierarch, eventually found a way to bring back four other Mentarchs and establish a Neo-Imperium of Lankharh, an empire that now stretches across both the continents of Realmz and Anarym. Thus, for the last six and a half centuries, ˜it has been Imperial Law that mongrels such as you be slaves and nothing else.

Yet, you know somehow that these shadowy beings are linked with your oppressors, the Mentarchs. So you face them off with a grim smile, trying to smite them all!      ˆA new day begins for you. All your life you have been a slave in the Imperial mines. But you eventually discovered a way to escape this hopeless place, finding enough courage to free yourselves at the risk of being hunted down as escaped slaves.          ¸in order to be free in death of this pitiful life that you were born to live. However, the whispered stories did offer some hope for those who would believe them: rebels, all escaped slaves as it was told, were fighting against the oppressors. Somehow,   ¯such stories did keep hope alive and strong within you, eventually inspiring the courage to escape from the dreary imperial mines and seek out these rebels. And today, after weeks of hiding and fleeing imperial patrols, you have finally found them!       ¸As you gaze around the rebel camp, a bit at a loss, a man and a woman walk up to you. "Welcome to New Canaan!" The man greets you, smiling. The woman nods in greeting, smiling as well. "He's Riel Half-Elven," she explains, pointing to the man, "and I'm   ¯Starina Tearmoon. 'New Canaan' is the name we've given our camp." Riel winks: "I assume you must be hungry and thirsty and all," he adds, "but first we have to take you to our esteemed leader ... you know, making proper introductions and all that."       ˜Starina chuckles. "Riel is ever one for grandiose events and formalities, despite that he's a true scoundrel at heart!" As Riel pretends to be offended by this remark, you laugh along with Starina, having almost forgotten such feelings of elation.        ¸"Miscreants!" Riel adds with flourish. "Here I am trying to restore civility and good manners in us ex-slaves, and what do I get?" He shakes his head gravely, adding to his pretense of dramatic despair. "Come, now!" Starina chimes in, still chuckling.    Ò"Let us go see our leader before our good Riel faints at our utter contempt for proper etiquette! Our leader's house is just ahead, near our temple." You raise your eyebrows at that. "Yes," Riel adds with a smile, "the Gods are still alive!"              ıYou've often heard rumors that the Mentarchs had not killed all the Gods, contrary to what the Neo-Imperium always claimed, and that the Gods were in fact preparing the arrival of the Destined - those who would free all races from the Mentarchs.          ¯Riel shakes his head: "A thousand questions you must have ... naturally! Let us go now see our Leader, and almost all of them will be answered!" At his insistence, and that of Starina's, you let yourselves be taken to the house of the rebel Leader.

ÆLooking at each other, you wonder if the dream and this incredible, miraculous event are somehow related. If so, who or what is behind all of this?

Starina whispers.                                       Suddenly, a wave of nausea grips some members of your group. Bending over in pain, they feel as if their bodies are burning up!                                                                                                                                !The place is closed at this hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ˚"Greetings and be welcome!" This man intones, shaking your hand while smiling. His grey eyes are lit with a shrewd intelligence and betray much wisdom and goodwill. "I am Anthraxus Wildstorm." He adds, his voice deep and strong, yet warm and friendly.    A vivid image suddenly flashes into your mind, where Anthraxus Wildstorm's features are replaced by those of a mighty warrior clad in full plate armor. His face becomes hidden by a fearsome, full-face warhelm as he raises a powerful sword!                ˝From within this warrior's helm, Anthraxus' piercing grey eyes burn with the fires of lust for power, of hunger for victory and of unrelenting ruthlessness. How could you have such an unsettling vision, when you have never met Anthraxus before? And what  ˚does this mean? As you begin to sway and reel from the vision's power, you feel Riel grab you to prevent your collapse. "What is wrong?" A concerned Anthraxus asks. "These poor folks must be tired." Riel mumbles, while trying to keep you on your feet.    Ê"It is customary for all newcomers to be introduced to me," Anthraxus continues, "but in your case, I shall make this short so as to allow you a well-deserved rest. A hut will be made available to you: this will be your new home."                         ÌAnthraxus smiles: "Go there to rest. I also invite you to go to our commissary to get some basic equipment, as well as food and water. We all share here, so feel at ease to take whatever you need. Then, come back to speak again with me."                  ËHe then turns to Starina: "I believe there is plenty of room in yours and Riel's hut?" Starina nods with a grin: "There certainly is! I welcome more folks, since their presence will keep Riel and his advances away from me at night!"                       ÊAs everyone has a good-natured laugh at Riel's expense, Starina enjoins you to follow her. "Come!" She chuckles, "I'll show you to your new home." Riel lets out a grunt while throwing you a wink: "No one's taking my bed, however!"                         OAs you take your leave, Anthraxus returns to his discussions with his advisors.

Out of these, one man stands out.   ıAlthough dressed in simple trousers and shirt, his calm demeanor exudes leadership. Next to him is a robed man who appears to be busy listening to all that is being discussed by the others. This robed man then sees you, peering at you intensely.          ıWith a nudge, he brings your presence to the attention of the first man, the one that appears to be the leader, who in turn smiles and motions you to come to him.

The orc replies, as a dwarf dressed in brown robes mumbles to himself while gazing at you. "They speak truth." The robed dwarf then proclaims, smiling at the same time. At that, the others clamor their approval.         Ò"Then be welcome here!" The orcs booms with a wide grin. "Be welcome among your peers!" He adds, while motioning you to cross through the opening gates. Amidst the shouted congratulations from the other armed folks, you go through the gates.

Over the years since this place was settled, our population has grown!"            ÛHe chuckles. "New families have been founded, while other slaves like you have managed to find this refuge of ours ... and all are of course welcome. And so today, New Canaan is a largely self-sufficient community, hiding from our oppressors."            ÒThe robed man next to Anthraxus then coughs, prompting another chuckle out of the rebel leader. "Of course," Anthraxus adds, "us rebels have had help all along from those lankharhans who oppose the God-Emperors, good folks like Oberon here."              ˝The robed man bows politely at that, his piercing gaze never leaving yours. "Indeed," Oberon adds, "not all of us born with the Gift of mental powers approve of the mad God-Emperors. In many ways, we are their submissive subjects and thus lack freedom."  ÃAnthraxus nods. "Aye. We non-psionics may be slaves or born of slaves, but all psionics must blindly obey the God-Emperors or face the same end as ours for disobedience: death." He pauses, then brightens:                                                   ı"However, much hope has been renewed for all slaves and lankharhans since we've found the means to speak with the True Gods once again!" Oberon steps forward at that: "The God-Emperors managed to fool all of us, and our ancestors, into believing          ˛that they had killed all the Gods. Ever since their Second Rising, and establishment of this Neo-Imperium that now rules over much of the World, they have been crafty at erasing magic and faith, thus ensuring the supremacy of psionics as the only power." ˛"But," Anthraxus interjects, "many throughout the centuries never forgot about the Gods. And of course, the Gods never forgot about us! Thus, slowly but surely, magic and faith was rediscovered, as you have witnessed already." Anthraxus pauses once more. ı"Unfortunately, trouble is brewing." The rebel leader goes on. "The God-Emperors have somehow sensed the rebirth of magic and faith, and are therefore wary. In the case of our beloved community, being so close to an imperial town like Ylsasnorh,          Úwe stand much in danger of being discovered by the God-Emperors. Indeed, our magic and faith are begining to stand out as beacons easily spotted by any God-Emperor who would happen to look our way." He sighs while shaking his head in despair.             ¯"It is therefore only a matter of time before New Canaan is discovered: should this happen, we are not strong or numerous enough to withstand a single God-Emperor, let alone one leading a full imperial army against us!" Oberon then gestures to you:       ˚"This is where all of you come into the picture" The robed man muses. "Our priests have received auguries from the Gods, showing them the means by which New Canaan could be shielded from the mental scrutiny of any God-Emperor." Anthraxus nods at that.    ¸"Aye." The rebel leader adds. "There is a cave east of here, called the Cave of Wailing Winds. The auguries have said that this cave leads to a means of protection for New Canaan. Some kind of holy book to be found there, the auguries said." He pauses.   ¯"So," Anthraxus continues, "I charge you to journey to this cave and find this holy book, then bring it back to us so our priests can study it and find the prayers that will create this protection that the auguries spoke of. Here is a map for you."       ˝"I wish you all safe journeys and safer returns." Anthraxus adds, after handing you the map. "Yeah, boss. Thanks a lot!" Riel mumbles, pretending to be irritated. "And do not forget." Oberon adds, while struggling to suppress a chuckle, "Stay clear from  ˙Ylsasnorh, lest you be caught by the imperials!" Starina clicks her tongue: "No worries with me along!" She replies. At that, Anthraxus clasps your arm: "If you haven't yet, go equip yourselves at our commisary."

A gleaming sword in each hand, the statue stands poised to attack - although it remains still and silent.      ˛As you approach the back of the cave, you notice a stone coffer flanked by two crumbling columns of marble. Suddenly, the strange, eight-armed statue comes to life! At first turning its head left and right as if shaking off a stiff neck, it then gazes at ûyou with its glowing eyes. Without taking its eyes off you, the statue takes a few steps forward in order to position itself between you and the stone coffer.                                                                                                 ˜"I AM THE GUARDIAN OF THE KEY."

Oberon adds, massaging his smarting back while showing a grimace of discomfort. "We must be very careful and plan meticulously anything we decide to do against the God-emperors." Anthraxus nods thoughtfully at that.    ÷"Aye, we have much to discuss." The rebel leader muses. "Honored Destined, I enjoin you to take a well deserved rest.

FSome sort of force field is preventing you from approaching this door.                                                                                                                                                                                         ÏLooking into this strange, floating globe, you see numerous scenes being played out. Battles, meetings, revolutions, wars, invasions, and so on. Some of these scenes appear to be obviously from the past, whereas others you cannot place.                   ·You can't help but remember the last words of the Oracle of the temple of Infinity, concerning those 'untouched' by the hourglass and even being 'keepers' and 'masters' of it ... With this in mind, you start to follow Oberon.                              DWith a sigh of fatigue and weariness, you continue to follow Oberon.                                                                                                                                                                                           ¸"Do come in and be welcome." Oberon tells you, still smiling warmly. "Welcome to the Towers of the Hourglass. I know that you must feel somewhat disoriented - but do not worry, for this feeling will pass shortly." He then motions you to walk up to him.   ˆAs you stand before him, Oberon then scrutinizes your faces with his piercing gaze. "Hmm, yes." He mumbles to himself, before smiling kindly once again: "Time travel can be a wrenching experience at best. Being thrown out of time is worse for the         ˛non-initiated such as you." Seeing your confused looks, he chuckles. "I know you must have a million or so questions that demand answers. But it is rather obvious that you do need to rest first, for your minds are feeling the strain of being out of time  ¸for the -first time- if you'll forgive the pun. For now then, I will tell you this much and then you'll go rest." Oberon then takes a deep breath, before continuing: "I am a chronomancer -a wizard that specializes in the study and manipulation of time,   ˝seeking to understand its nature and its inner workings. Those like me, as well as priests that serve Quanthaas -the God of Time, Cycles and Eternity-, are all part of the secret Order of the Hourglass. We are not only students of temporal mechanics, as  ˜well as history, but we are also the guardians of time. This is our primary responsibility, especially under the watchful eyes of Quanthaas. That is why he gave us the Towers of the Hourglass -a giant fortress really- that stands apart from time."        ˘He then raises his hand to ward off any questions from you. "Now, I know this must be hard to understand -but I suppose you'll have to trust me on this. Since we of the Hourglass live apart from time, it is therefore quite easy for us to travel from      ˚one time period to another, as well as from one alternate timeline to another." He then smiles at your reaction to those last words: "Aye. You now have some inkling as to the existence of such divergent realities. But more on that once you've rested."    ˛He then points to the door that is immediately down to his right: "Go to the guest quarters. You'll understand that you won't be able to visit much of the place, since it -is- supposed to be very secret. Go rest now, good people." At that, he disappears. 2This is a bathroom, complete with tub and commode.                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,"Nice place!"

ÛThen it happens: your minds feeling as if sundered apart, your true and original personalities emerge! As if living a vivid dream, all your former memories, hopes and pains return in rapid succession, as if you are traveling faster than light!            ˛The year is 1168, Realmz Reckoning. You are seasoned adventurers, natives of the Sword Lands. You were around when the Troubles began in 1166 R.R., caused by psionicists who called themselves Overlords. You had learned that their goal was to conquer the  ˘Sword Lands, in order to have a powerbase that would help bring back the Mentarchs -or Mind Lords- and establish a new empire ruled by these terrible god-like beings. But another group of adventurers beat you to the Overlords and solved the troubles      ˚before you. Then the Great War came in 1167 R.R., when the warlord Anthraxus Storm -not "Wildstorm"- sought in turn to conquer the lands, apparently with the help of more Overlords. You fought as mercenaries in that war, helping to repel the invaders.    ˝During that time, you heard that the Heroes of the Sword Lands -those that had solved the troubles a year earlier- also played a part in the war, then chased after the leader of the Overlords, High Praetor Primus, all the way to the continent of Anarym.  ÎIt was then that your life simply stopped and you became slaves in the Neo Imperium of the Mentarchs, along with full memories of being born as slaves and always living as such. But how could this be? What happened to have caused this?                    RNow more than ever, you need to rest ... and then finally get answers from Oberon!                                                                                                                                                                             Ë"By the Gods." Riel mumbles, as much in pain and confused as you are. "I remember who I am: Riel Moonsong, minstrel. I'm a companion of the Heroes of the War of the Sword Lands. It was right after the war that we went after Primus."                       ¸He shakes his head in despair: "We found his powerbase in the island-nation of Umaldyr, near Anarym. Except it was not a powerbase, but some ancient gateway that he managed to activate. We couldn't stop him, especially since he turned out to be hosting   ˛the still-living essence of Maximus, first and most powerful of the Mentarchs! Primus/Maximus tried to kill us, but the psi-knight Naryl Thezzat sacrificed her life to save us. Then he went through the gateway and ... and ... and then I was a slave, with œthe evil Mentarchs returned as god-emperors! But how? Unless ...?" He then gazes at you with a look of dread: "Could it be that the gateway allowed him to travel back in time, so he could change everything?"                                                ŒHe then starts to tremble nervously: "Oh my. And what has become of my friends, the Heroes of the War? And poor Naryl -may the Gods protect her brave soul." He then turns his back to you to weep in silence.                                                 ˙The year is 1168, Realmz Reckoning. You are the Heroes of the Sword Lands, who solved the Troubles caused by the Overlords, back in 1166 R.R. You then left the Sword Lands for further adventures. During your journeys, on the year 1167 R.R., you heard     ˆnews that the warlord Anthraxus Storm had begun a war of conquest of the Sword Lands. The news also spoke of more Overlords apparently helping him. Although you were quite far away in the north of the Realmz continent, you had set with haste on a         Ôjourney back to the Sword Lands. During the long trek, you kept hearing news that other adventurers, who became known as Heroes of the War of the Sword Lands, were already helping and trying to eradicate all the Overlords once and for all.                âYou had heard that they were even chasing after the leader of the Overlords, High Praetor Primus, all the way to the continent of Anarym.                                                                                                                      ¯The year is 1168, Realmz Reckoning. You are the Heroes of the Sword Lands, who played a great part in the War of 1167 R.R., when Anthraxus Storm sought to conquer the Sword Lands. At the same time, you sought out the remaining Overlords in order to       ˚defeat them once and for all. You had found out the powerbase of High Praetor Primus -leader of the Overlords- and forced a final showdown there. But it turned out that he was hosting the essence of the Hierarch Maximus, first and most powerful of the    ˛Mentarchs. He tried to destroy you and your comrades, but you were saved by the sacrifice of your dear friend, the psi-knight Naryl Thezzat. At the same time, Primus/Maximus activated a gate he had restored and stepped through it, leaving you behind with Ma final parting: "See you yesterday, today and tomorrow!" He had taunted you.                                                                                                                                                                                  ¸"By the Gods." Riel mumbles, as much confused and in pain as you are. "My friends!" He then exclaims, gazing at you in wonderment and joy. After many embraces and accolades, Riel shakes his head in sadness: "I wonder what happened to our other friends,   ˘like Jhalor, Strider or even Braggan." He sighs deeply, his eyes rimed with tears: "And poor Naryl - may the Gods protect her brave soul." With your memories back, you can't fight the intense sense of loss and mourning that you 'still' feel for your      ˙departed friend. "I wonder how or what happened, exactly." Riel mumbles on as he wipes the tears from his eye. He then turns to you with a look of dread: "Could it be that the gate Primus/Maximus used allowed him to travel in time, so he could change     everything? And if so, what can we do about it?" Gripping gently Riel's shoulder to reassure him, you shake your head slowly to show that you have not a clue. "Well, at least we're back together." Riel adds with a whisper, smiling ruefully.               ˝"Oh, lordy!" Nasslass mumbles, massaging his bald head. "Me guess nothing's the same anymore ... or is it just back the way it's supposed to be?" He groans at that, then looks at you impishly: "Me name's really Nasslass, by the by. Me be an adventurer."  ¯He sighs. "Me figures that though me don't know ye as me thought we knew each other, me should tag along anyways - if only to teach a lesson to whoever's reponsible fer confusing me poor head and life like that!" With a mischievous wink and a final       Kgroan, the tired kobold heads to one of the cots to take a much needed nap.                                                                                                                                                                                    ˘"It would seem that the turn of events is quite, ah, intriguing to say the least." Starina muses, her demeanor quite serious and aloof. "I am the enchantress Starrune." She adds formally, inclining her head. "I assume there must be a valid reason as      ˝to why Oberon chose to extract all of us from what seems to have been an alternate timeline. I would venture to add that I suspect we did not belong in that timeline -or maybe that this timeline is not supposed to exist at all." She shrugs nonchalantly.  Å"I suppose we'll find out from Oberon soon enough." She adds pensively, before laying down on one of the beds to grab some sleep.                                                                                                                              ˚"Talk about your skull-splitting headache!" Nerylka mumbles between clenched teeth, as she sits on one of the cots. She then casts a rueful look at you, smiling shyly: "I am Nerylka Dhan, a witch. Like you, I have many questions as to why we are here,    Ïand what exactly we have to do with that alternate timeline Oberon took us out from." She yawns at that, visibly drained. "I don't know about you guys, but I need a good rest before tackling all those questions and the answers to come."                   6She then lays on the bed and closes her eyes to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                         ¸With a sigh, you turn your attention back to your original equipment, the sight of which initiated the full return of your true memories.

"Good!" the leader replies, rubbing his hands in satisfaction.        ˚"After many discussions with Oberon and my lieutenants, we all agree that a more proactive approach against the God-emperors must be undertaken." Anthraxus chuckles to himself: "Of course, we can't tackle all of them at once! So we will start with the    Ûfirst one: Uther Maddrix." The rebel leader pauses thoughtfully. "Maddrix is the one who rules all of the Sword Lands, including our own little -and remote- northwestern region. But before moving openly against him, we need vital information!"            ˚Oberon then takes up the narrative: "Indeed, we do. We must know the exact numbers of troops stationed in and around Ylsasnorh -the trading town north of here-, as well as any imperial masters and tribunes. We must know also of any troop movements or     ˝reinforcements. And most importantly: we must know when Maddrix comes to Ylsasnorh during his inspection rounds." Anthraxus sighs: "It is a lot that we must know, but we must gather this information or any attempt to move will result in our decimation."  ˛Oberon then chuckles: "So of course, we need some help from the -ah- 'inside'. And we may have such help: a woman named Selina has been a sympathizer to us and the great cause of overthrowing the Mind Lords. She firmly believes in equality for all races, ˚regardless of whether one has the Gift or not. She has been keeping an ear open for us, in order to tip us off on any rumor concerning New Canaan being found or such other things. But now, we will ask much, much more of her." Anthraxus nods gravely at    ¸that: "Aye. We need you to go into Ylsasnorh, make contact with Selina and deliver her new orders. Here's a map showing the location of her house; try to go to her only during the evening or night, as to avoid being seen. Knock on her door and give her   ˝the password, which is 'psion'. Be careful as you journey to Ylsasnorh and always remember that you can be found out at any moment -if only because of your lack of psionic abilities. Simply enter the town, head straight to Selina's house, then get out."  àAnthraxus then hands you the map. "Be careful, and may the Gods protect you!"

ÒThe woman waits for you, having already seated herself. She looks rather attractive but quite composed, if not reserved. "Welcome to my humble abode." She greets you, nodding slightly. As she speaks, you notice something strange in her eyes.              ˝"I am Selina Vack. Why have you come here?" She asks, gazing fiercely into your eyes as she speaks. You still can't quite put your finger on what exactly it is that you see in her brown eyes. Shrugging it off, you deliver her new orders from Anthraxus.   ˚Suddenly, numerous imperial soldiers appear, surrounding you and Selina. Looking at her in shock, you see now a defeated look in her eyes. "I tried to warn you ..." She whispers. A man dressed in robes advances towards you, grinning proudly: "I am the    ˝Imperial Master Dracks, chief operative spy for His Holy Majesty and Mentarch, Uther Maddrix. For months we've been keeping the traitorous Selina Vack under tight surveillance, knowing that rebel scum like you would eventually contact her." He chuckles.  ﬂ"Now, we only need to capture you," he goes on, "and you will tell us where your hiding place is!" With a snap of his fingers, the imperial soldiers move in. At the same time, Selina whips up a dagger to fight by your side!                                ˛Panting and tired, you hear Selina moan. Lying on the floor, she has almost bled to death. "Go to ...

"You've rested well?" he asks, smiling warmly. He then grins: "And I see you've retrieved your former attire. I've also brought forth some of what you kept stored in the other timeline, as you noticed." ‡He then sighs: "I might as well get right into it and tell you everything - this will make things much quicker and less complicated. As you may have already guessed, the timeline of our world has been changed -drastically-."                               ˛Oberon shakes his head with sadness. "Do you remember that confrontation of last year with the Overlord Primus?" You nod. "That portal that he used sent him in the past -or rather, sent him *and* the essence of the Hierarch Xenon Maximus, which he hosts. ˚That was Maximus' plan all along ... to go back to a point in time in order to free the imprisoned essences of his fellow Mentarchs." Seeing your looks of confusion, Oberon goes on: "In the long-gone days of the fabled empire of Lankharh, twelve human    Úbeings were created, each designed to be a psionicist of incredible power in order to become wise and strong leaders of the ever growing population of the empire. Great magic and science were used to create these twelve beings, who were named             ˛'Mentarchs' for the god-like mental powers they possessed. Xenon Maximus was the first born, and thus became the Hierarch -the Overseer of the Mentarchs-. But those men and women who designed and created the Mentarchs did not account for one very crucial ˜fact: the human brain, even one of a powerful psionicist, cannot hold -and control- such god-like mental powers without paying a heavy toll." Oberon sighs again. "And that toll is sanity: in time, the Mentarchs gradually became further and further        ıdecadent, corrupted and evil. All Mentarchs became ruthless despots -all that is, save three of them. Umma Porogrove, Shalym Relimanab and Kith Khanaan realized early on the danger of being born with too much power, and sought quickly to prevent          ıtheir descent into insanity through powerful magics. But the other nine -Sappho Nynex, Aura Jinsyng, Makkan Xaotyn, Ollora Athalante, Nuul Zarrakian, Azure Malachys, Zoros Ultimanax, Uther Maddrix and Xenon Maximus- refused to accept the reality          ˝of their fate. And the more the 'Noble Three' attempted to convince the nine others, the more tension and strain increased in their relationships ... even among the nine themselves. With the depravities enacted by the 'Evil Nine', with paranoia settling  ˙within their diseased and deranged brains, it came to pass that an all out war errupted among the Mentarchs. At first, this 'War of the Mind Lords' consisted of the Evil Nine seeking to destroy the goodly Noble Three. However, the insane Nine came to     ˚even war among themselves, their evil ambitions having no bounds. At one point, the Hierarch Maximus managed to rein in his warring eight siblings by giving them a new purpose which satisfied their insane egos: conquest of the world and enslavement of    ˘all non-psionic races. The Noble Three did the opposite: they rallied lankharhans and non-psionics to oppose the reunited Evil Nine. In the end, history records that the Nine were eventually defeated, the war leaving the lankharhan empire in ruins."      ˛Oberon shakes his head in resignation: "What is not known is what happened exactly to the Evil Nine and the Noble Three. As you know, the essences of the Mentarchs are quite long-lived -but they can be destroyed, especially when being forced to remain in ¸'free form' -without a host- for more than one hour. Of the Evil Nine, only the essences of Uther Maddrix, Sapho Nynex, Nuul Zarrakian, Azure Malachys and Xenon Maximus survived the war; with the exception of Maximus, who somehow managed to escape, the   ˙essences of the surviving evil mentarchs were imprisoned in mystical orbs for eternity -the price for having caused such death, destruction and devastation to lankharhans and non-psionics alike. Of the Noble Three, only Kith Khanaan survived the War.     ˚This selfless Mentarch took it upon himself to find a proper hiding place for the imprisoned evil Mentarchs, far away from the continent of Anarym: such a place he found in the Sword Lands, on the Realmz continent. But as you well know, the essence of    ˛of Maximus was eventually found by Primus, who then became the new host of the Hierarch. It is not known how Maximus survived all those millennia -it is presumed that he jumped from one host to another, keeping a low profile all along." Oberon sighs once ‚more. "In any case, Primus/Maximus discovered a few years ago the locale where Kith Khanaan hid the mystic orbs -but the place had been destroyed after a natural disaster some centuries past, hopelessly burying the mystic orbs                             ˙as well. That's when Primus/Maximus realized that he needed to go back to a point in time in the past, prior to that natural disaster, to extract the mystic orbs and free his remaining siblings. And once there in the past, the reunited evil Mentarchs     ˜gathered power and armies, gradually re-establishing the Lankharh empire. This you have come to know as the 'Second Rising' and the 'Neo-Imperium' during your life in the alternate timeline -one that was created the moment Primus/Maximus freed his        ısiblings in the past." Oberon shakes his head. "But we of the Hourglass were watching and knew what had been done. However, changing the timeline back to what it is *supposed* to be is far more complicated that simply changing it. So we searched          “far and wide among various parallel timelines to establish the proper course of action to re-establish our correct timeline and find the proper people to help us achieve it." He then winks at you mischievously:                                             ¯"We have the plan and we have *you*!

To      ¯help you from making such a catastrophic mistake, I am giving you a small historic lexicon as a guide you can consult at will, as well as a small spell I will dweomer you with and which will make you aware whenever you are about to change history."       ¸After giving you the lexicon and casting his spell, Oberon smiles at you: " Before I forget, that spell I put upon you will also allow you to understand, read and speak any language. I thought this could come in handy! You also have a Stone of Recall."   ı"Use it to return when you are done. Now, walk to the portal, for I have now activated it: step into it and you will be sent back to the Sword Lands of the year 529 R.R.! May Quanthaas look kindly upon you!"

You also notice that a warm light permeates the place, although you can't find any source of light.           ’Contrary to the other statues of the place, this statue is the only one that depicts a human being. Upon closer inspection, you find that it depicts a wise and stately leader of men ... or even perhaps of nations.                                          fYou notice a small pressure plaque located behind the statue, at its base.

Just as the released Mind Lord moves in for the attack, Primus/Maximus is transported away!           ˛Uther Maddrix' dying essence dissipates violently, bolts of psionic energies flying in all directions. From your standpoint, you see that Primus/Maximus' contraption is also assaulted by the raging energies. Then, all of a sudden, all becomes quiet anew. >"Now what?"

But not anymore!"                  ˙"I suspect they are part of that marauder gang that has been terrorizing the roads lately.

Looking at you, then in turn at your fallen opponents, she smiles grimly.                                                                                                          gNot having completed your task, you decide not to bother Michiko and leave her to tend to her business.                                                                                                                                                        ¯Smiling, you tell Michiko that you have rid her inn of those ruffians once and for all. "Splendid!" She exclaims, visibly relieved and happy. "I shall honor my word as you have honored yours, noble adventurers." At that, she produces a small chest.       ˝"And something else." Michiko adds, producing a strange pair of gloves. "These belonged to my great-great-great grandmother who was a wandering monk before settling down. She found those gloves during one of her many adventures, and they have since been  passed down in her family from one generation to the next. However, I feel your monk is better deserving than I to honor the memory of my ancestor. I trust these wondrous gloves will be put to good and noble use, instead of acquiring dust."               õ"Again, I thank you, noble ones." Michiko bows to you once more, out of respect and gratitude.

"I mean, he looks like him, albeit just a bit younger -by no more than two or three years, I'd say! This is amazing!"              ÇThis dwarven warrior nods politely at your approach, then returns to his conversation with his ranger comrade sitting next to him.                                                                                                                             ¯This dwarven warrior nods politely at your approach. Then, with a mischievous smile, he turns to the ranger sitting with him: "Me told ye they'd do it. Ye owe me drinks fer the next sevenday, as our bet calls!" He announces proudly, with a chuckle.       ı"Indeed, you have the keenest eye for bets!" The ranger replies jokingly. "I am Raack Strongbow," he goes on, seeing your confusion, "and this dwarven 'Lord of Bets' is Galduur Ironshield." You manage to hide your surprise upon hearing the name.          ˘"We've been keeping an 'interested' eye on you, ever since your arrival in the area." Raack adds, smiling warmly. "Bah!" Galduur interjects, "What me old friend's trying to say is that he wanted to take care of them bad guys the way ye did already."      ¸The dwarf then leans closer to you in a conspiratorial manner: "Ye see, this goody-two-boots feels he's to take care of everything by himself to protect the folks of the kingdom. Since me knows better than him what's good fer him," he adds with a wink,   ı"me bet him that ye'd do it by yerselves! And ye did!" Galduur turns back to his comrade, laughing aloud: "See? Me told ye that ye needed to enjoy a good rest, fer once!" In response, Raack pretends to be offended: "Sure. All along, this bet was          ˜an excuse for you to drink your mead without a care, and with this bet you covered your back for a chance to drink some more!" Raack intones, pointing an accusing finger at his friend. "Me couldn't lose either way!" Galduur replies, laughing more.        ˛Then suddenly, Galduur swigs the last of his tankard. "Nothing but me beloved Dwarven Halls mead fer me!" He tells you, with a wink. "In any case," Raack continues, turning back to you while pretending to be annoyed with the dwarf, "I wish to extend well ˚deserved congratulations to you, for the deed you've accomplished. Galduur and I have been looking into these banditry problems in the last few months, and we've arrived at the conclusion that these marauders and bandits are the tip of a big iceberg."    “"Aye." Galduur goes on, with a very serious tone in his voice. "We think there be some kind of network of camps like that one, ultimately leading to someone very powerful who seeks to conquer the Iron Kingdom!"                                             ˙"Be that as it may," Raack interjects with a wink, "it seems that you brave folks have these matters well in hand: we trust you'll be able to uncover the power behind these ruffians, if you haven't already. Galduur and I will busy ourselves with some     Ûother mischief!" Galduur grumbles at that: "Aye. Fire giants be threatening the new kingdom of Lantharond. Innocent folks be in grave danger there, so off we go!" The dwarf then gathers his gear: "Safe journeys and safer returns!" He bids you,            xclasping your hand. "Walk far and safe." Raack adds, doing the same. At that, the two heroes leave the Sleepless Dragon.                                                                                                                                       ˚"We've been keeping an 'interested' eye on you, ever since your arrival in the area." Raack adds, smiling warmly. Not only does this man looks like the Strider you know, but his voice and his mannerisms are the very same as well. How is this possible?    ¥"Bah!" Galduur interjects loudly, wrenching you away from your musings, "What me old friend's trying to say is that he wanted to take care of them bad guys the way ye did already."                                                                           ˜other mischief!"

Seeing an opportunity to ask them instead to help you in your quest, and considering        éthat Oberon's spell is not ringing any alarms in your head, do you tell Galduur and Raack who you truly are and why you have come in the past?

At that, the two heroes leave the Sleepless Dragon.             ˜With great care, you explain to the two heroes how you came to be in the past and why. "An amazing tale, indeed." Raack muses, with a rueful grin -so much like the Strider you know. For an instant, you have the urge to ask him about this. However,        ¸Oberon's spell then kicks in to warn you silently against this course of action. "It is somewhat ironic" Raack goes on, "how the long dead past of ages ago collided with the future -your present-, and then finding an escape in our present -your past-!"   ˛Galduur then groans: "Enough! Me's getting a headache already from all that time nonsense!" He then starts batting his hand in irritation at your reaction of disapointment: "Me believe ye, me does." He adds with a gruff voice. "There be folks to be saved ˝and it don't matter that they be from the durn future -so, of course we'll help ye!" Raack then chuckles mischievously: "Besides, from your account, there's some 'time' before that Primus fellow gets here ... so, why don't we join forces in the meantime  ˘to find out who is the true power behind those marauders and bandits?" In response, Galduur raises a newly refilled tankard of Dwarven Halls mead: "Me'll drink to that!" After gulping down his drink, the dwarf gathers his gear. He then turns to you:      ˘"Well?" He demands gruffly, his fists planted on his hips. "What're we waiting fer? Let us be off, then!" Laughing while pretending resignation, Raack gathers his gear as well: "Are you sure you want the pair of us fools along?" He asks with a wink.

At that, he signals the others to attack!                                                        µPanting and tired, you take a quick look around about this room: from the large table set in the center and covered with maps and raiding plans, this must then be a conference room.                                                                          tThis corridor is unfinished -obviously, this whole place was only recently constructed and remained to be completed.                                                                                                                                           ÏOn the conference table, you find a hand-written letter tagged onto a small map: "I know this is a burden, Durnon, but this is where Stygiax and Maladore want us to meet their liaison agent from now on, when we need to report verbally".                   Î"Apparently" the letter goes on, "all has been set up for you, Jax and me with the proper privileges and free access to meet the bosses' liaison in the place's member-exclusive area. Until next time, I wish you success! Signed: Ariel".                    5You find a chest here.

I suppose you wonder how he managed to power that machine of his to send himself back to the present?"                                                                    ∏You were indeed wondering about that, considering that powering time-machines seem to require power stones -the last one of which you yourself saw used up by Primus/Maximus, last year.                                                                       Ô"Many old ruins were more or less intact still, back in 529 R.R." Oberon goes on. "He must have explored some of the old macremian ruins in the Khanark Rockies and managed to find a power stone good enough to power his make-shift machine."                ÊOberon sighs again: "Well, again, the great news is that the timeline has been set aright. Now, it's a matter of formulating the proper course of action to put Maximus, and his three surviving siblings, in check once and for all."                         ˘The chronomancer then looks at Galduur, mouth agape and in shock: "What? Who- How?" He then looks at you in panic: "What is *he* doing here with you? And how come my time protection spell did nothing to prevent this?" Galduur winks at you, grinning.      ˜The dwarf hero is obviously enjoying the situation. Oberon finally manages to gather is composure back: "Umm, well ... I *must* discuss this with my peers as well, to ascertain any potential damage to the timeline for having brought Galduur here!"        é"Go take a good rest, and we'll meet on the morrow." Oberon finally adds, taking back the Stone of Recall and the Lexicon, before disapearing.                                                                                                                 ´"Ye sure keep strange company!" Galduur muses, chuckling to himself. "So? How about that rest? And mayhaps there be some decent mead here, somewhere?" He adds with a wink.                                                                                    ÒOberon is waiting for you, smiling warmly. "Good, you are back! I have great news!" He seems genuinely excited. "After much discussion with my peers, we have established that Maximus must indeed be destroyed -as long as he remains, in a host              ˝or without one, he will always be too great of a threat and is likely to try to alter the timeline again. So, I am sending you back to the present -the correct one, that is, thanks to your efforts- on the continent of Anarym. The Azure Coast area, to be  ˆmore precise." Oberon smiles kindly at your surprise. "To make a long story short, the Mentarchs were created through magics and sciences that have been lost since the fall of the Lankharh empire. The place where this was done is now known as the         ˘Forbidden City, located deep in the Forgotten Valley. In turn, this virgin, tropical forest valley lies just east of the port city of Seacrest, on the Azure Coast of Anarym. Once there, you must find the means to access the Forbidden City -sadly, we      ˘haven't yet found out how this can be done, so I'm afraid it will be up to you. Once you reach the city, I'll join you then. We are convinced that Primus/Maximus returned there, after fleeing from you in the past. So, find him and destroy him, along      Jthe three other Mentarchs he rescued!" You nod with determination at that.                                                                                                                                                                                     ÙOberon then turns to Galduur, with a mischievous grin: "It would seem that you being brought along with these heroes fits exactly with the historical records concerning your 'mysterious disapearance' and thus poses no danger to the integrity of           Ÿthe timeline. Furthermore, with the normal timeline restored and all, we called upon someone else to join all of you -someone that I'm sure sir Galduur will be happy to see again." At Oberon's words, in walks Strider!                                      ˙"Me knew it!" Galduur exclaims, rushing to his old friend to clout him affectionately on the shoulder. "Me knew there was something about yer lifespan!" Smiling ruefuly, tears riming his bright blue eyes, Strider smiles down on Galduur: "Aye, my dear     ˚old friend. All these centuries, how I have hoped that a day like today would come and that we'd be reunited once again!" Strider then looks at you: "I know that I have a long story to tell about my -very- long life, especially to you and to Galduur."    ˚He chuckles. "Let's just say that many centuries ago I fell into a potion bath, and this potion soaked through my whole body, making me age only one day for each year that passes. And yes, I *did* recognize you back when we met 'for the first time' in    ˙the Sword Lands -but of course, I could not tell you that I had already met you in the past!" He winks at that. "Ye silly fool! Always taking on the burden of the world on yer shoulders!" Galduur adds, laughing with joy. After the laughter dies down,     ˆOberon harrumphs: "Well, of course, we of the Hourglass took a special interest in this exceptional man Zaal -" he then stops himself as Strider looks at him with a friendly warning. "-Strider, I meant!" Oberon catches himself. "Suffice it to say         ºthat this valiant man performed many services for us!" Strider then chuckles: "Well, in any case, it's time to save the world -yet again!" "Durn right!" Galduur adds, with much enthusiasm.                                                                   ;(Strider has joined your party.

So, we'll meet again once you reach the Forbidden City!" .At that, Oberon casts his teleportation spell.

Although not showing any wounds, he does look drawn and weak -probably from lack of water and food.

Ï"You have my thanks, good strangers." He intones with a rumbling voice, bowing his head in gratitude. You are somewhat surprised that he speaks the common tongue with near-perfection. "My name is Ssyslak. I am a pariah among my people."                   ˛He emits a sound akin to a sigh of sadness. "My people all too often stand on the dark side of things, which has always went against my own principles. Still, I was tolerated for I am the best hunter and tracker of my village. But lately, evil snake-like ıhuman priests have taken over my village, claiming kinship with my people but in truth beguiling them into becoming their puppets." He pauses to take another sip of water. "Like I said, my people are well known for their dark ways; however, they          ˛have never bothered the humans and elves to the south, preferring to keep to themselves here in the swamps. But these snake priests are enticing my people to actually march against those to the south, for their own dark plans." He shakes his head slowly. ˛"So I spoke out against those evil strangers -but then was forced to flee from my village in order to save my life. For a while, I wandered in these swamps -which I know rather well- until I decided to make the trek to the south and warn the good peoples ıthere, perhaps even recruiting help to free my village from the dark influences of the snake priests. Unfortunately, I was captured by this mad druid." Obviously grimacing with pain, Ssyslak goes on: "He has been experimenting with crocodilians,          ıseeking to mutate them into powerful monstrous versions. That crazy man told me that, since I'm a lizard man, he wanted to try the process on me to see what would happen. And then, you came along and freed me from whatever dire fate awaited me."          ›Ssyslak then rises up from the damp floor to bow respectfully to you: "Again, I thank you for your generosity. I would be proud to fight by your side, if only to repay in a small way the debt of gratitude that I owe you."                                  %Do you take Ssyslak into your party?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ‡Grinning -and thus showing his fearsome rows of teeth- Ssyslak takes out a wrinkled sheet of parchment from his backpack: "I am happy that you accept me into your group.

I know I'll remain a pariah, but at least I will have done what's right by my people." ÒThis lizard man has been dead for at least a week or two. The foul smell of his decomposing corpse makes you sick to your stomach. The poor wretch must have been captured by Chlorophus for whatever mad designs the druid had in store for him.              ΩSsyslak bows his head in an obvious gesture of disapointment. "I understand and respect your decision. By your grace, I shall take my leave." Without further due, the lizard man walks away.                                                                  "My friends." Strider chimes in. "As I am a ranger, so is this noble, principled lizard man. This I know to be the truth that I sense from him.

Until today, me never thought of ye as such."             iAt that, he turns around to stand by Strider's side, not bothering to hide his scowl of contempt for you.

Ù"The dwarven clan of the Duhelarym founded a great city underneath Lake Everspring, some five thousand years ago. As elves and humans gradually settled along the Azure Coast, new opportunities of trade for the dwarves were available. Thus, they           ¸constructed a fortress-tower on the small island that lies in the middle of the lake, which served not only as a trading post but also as a first line of defense. As kingdoms and cities were born and later destroyed, the duhelarym profited greatly from   ˙trade and were renowned for their exquisite craftmanship in metals and gems. Their undercity, Duhelarholme, acquired many names in those time - the humans called it Tora-Khaar and the elves called it Arkelonia, for example. Interestingly, the dwarves     ˙were excedingly overprotective of their holme, refusing anyone other then duhelarym dwarves to enter it - even excluding dwarves from other clans. This self-imposed isolation eventually cost them dearly, for they mined too deep in the underearth and,     ¸according to legends, awoke some sort of great evil. No help was sent to the dwarves, and much of what happened really remains folklore at best, because the dwarves were too secretive about their affairs. One thing is certain: they never asked for help   ˝and they were forced to abandon Duhelarholme. Again, legends say that only a few dozen kins of the clan survived whatever they awoke, deep down in the underearth. Since then, the undercity has been pretty much forgotten, whereas the fortress-tower built  ˙by the duhelarhym would be occupied often by mages, lords and would-be warlords. Today, this place remains barely standing and is known as Grag Keep. Legends insist that the means to enter lost Duhelarholme are to be found in Grag Keep - hence, there     çare many scholars and mages, seeking knowledge or power, are eager to know more of such means to enter Duhelarholme and plunder its secrets."                                                                                                                  *"Would you like to hear of another topic?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ˜You must understand that these two empires were incredibly advanced both in arcane arts and technology; hence, terrible weapons which blended the two arts were created and used during the Great War of the Empires; with devastating results as well.        ˝"Where to begin? One must journey back in time some fifteen millennia, during the age of the empires of Telluria and Macremia. Both empires emerged on our continent of Anarym, with Macremia more to the north and east, and Telluria to the south and west.  ˝Explorers from the two empires traveled far and wide, settling colonies nearly throughout the continent and beyond. One Tellurian colony was found north of here, in what is known today as the Scales Swamps. Back then, that area was a lush forest. But as  Such terrifying weapons were of course used by the major colonies of the empires over here, unleashing destruction and havok that not only shook the earth, but created new rivers, seas and mountains, while affecting the climate drastically.               ˛As the Tellurian and Macremian empires destroyed each other on Anary, so had their colonies here. Over time, the two empires were forgotten and their advanced knowledge was lost;  those few ruins that remain, such as those north of here, have always been äTelluria and Macremia began their Great War, so did their respective colonies throughout the continent, and even those far away from here.                                                                                                                     ˝shunned and feared, as they are believed to be cursed. Nonetheless, throughout the ensuing millennia, many a tale was told of fantastic artifacts being found amidst such ruins. But at this point, we may be crossing the line between fact and fiction ..."  ı"One must first know of the Lankharhans. This people established an empire some twelve thousand years ago on our continent of Anarym. This was a 'psionic' empire, since all Lankharhans were born with innate powers of the mind, or psionic powers.          ÔAlso, the empire was a peaceful one, growing only through willfull adherance of other countries or cities to the empire. There came a time when powerful psionic individuals rose to become Lords, Regents, Princes and Emperors of the Empire.                ÂThose were aptly named 'Mentarchs', or 'Mind Lords', and they brought about a golden age for all citizens of the Empire. Indeed, their mind powers almost equalled those of gods, and they could live for centuries if not even more.                          ÌHowever, most of the Mind Lords became increasingly mentally unstable with time, and they began to lust for the utter domination of all non-psionics (whom they considered mongrels fit only to be slaves), even of all ordinary Lankharhans.                  ÏIn effect, the Mind Lords had become nothing short of evil, ruthless god-like monsters bent on conquest, enslavement and destruction; they even began warring among themselves. Indeed, three of them stood against the other evil-mad nine.                   ÒBut in time, thanks to the three Mentarchs who managed to rally lankharhans and non-lankharhans alike, these devastating Wars brought about the fall of the Nine. Unfortunately, the Wars caused the fall of the Lankharhan civilization as well.              ˛Interestingly, a lengend has been passed on from one generation to the next ever since our area of the Azure Coast was settled. This legend speaks of a secret lankharhan city lying deep within the Forgotten Valley; this legend also tells a story that all ˙Mentarchs were born there, and consequently the place was considered holy by all lankharhans at the time. The legend is still going around today and the secret lankharhan city is now called the Forbidden City. Rumor has it that it can be found in the     Êsouth-east end of the Forgotten Valley, but that only true lankharhans or folks of direct lankharhan descent may enter it. Other rumors insist that the way to the city was sealed off for all time, when the Lankharhan empire fell."                         ˘"The greater Seacrest area is but a portion of the whole of the Azure Coast, which extends north all the way to the great city of Southgate and south to the northern-most borders of the kingdom of Kalimshyr, one of the so-called 'Southern Kingdoms'.      ¯By definition and convention, the greater Seacrest area comprise those lands that are nestled by the Scales Swamps to the north, the Azure Sea to the west, and the massive mountain range to its east and south, called the 'High Crystalmist Reaches'.       ¸In the lands of the greater Seacrest area, you will find of course the port city of Seacrest, which is a major trading center of the Azure Coast, as well as the island-city of Calember, a rising competitor of Seacrest. Other mainly human settlements in   ˆthe area are Edgemoor, which borders the Scales Swamps, Springdale, which rests on the western shore of the Everspring Lake, and the farming town of Wavyn, which lies just southeast of here. The major demi-human enclaves in the area are the elven         öforest-kingdom of Lorill, which encompasses nearly most of the Everspring Forest, and the gnomish mining town of Goldylock, which lies northeast of here."                                                                                                     ˘"The Scales Swamps lie north of the greater Seacrest area. Until fifteen to twelve thousand years ago, the Scales Swamps were a lush forest rich in arable land. However, climate changes -some think brought about by the Great War of the Macremian and      ıTellurian empires- modified the lush forest lands and slowly turned them into swamps, bogs and moors over a century or two. The Scales Swamps are a very dangerous place, being inhabited by trolls, lizard men, crocodiles and all sorts of terrible          ˘creatures. In fact, many a time have lords and kings attempted to create a foothold in the swamps by constructing forts or guard towers - but inevitably, such places were overrun by disease-carrying insects, monsters and other nasties, forcing their      Îabandonment. From the point of view of those who would be foolhardy enough to explore the swamps, two facts of interest are known: one, ancient Tellurian ruins lie about the center of the swamps, and two, a large river runs through the                    swamps from the Azure Sea to its eastern border, creating a passage through the massive High Crystalmist Reaches and connecting the swamps to the Forgotten Valley nestled within the Reaches. In any case, nothing else is known of the swamps,               kbecause so few have tried to explore them and even less managed to return alive to tell of their findings."                                                                                                                                                    ˆ"The Forgotten Valley is a large valley of tropical rainforest east of here, untouched by civilization. Nestled within the High Crystalmist Reaches, it remains essentially inaccessible by foot or horse, since the Reaches are too highly rugged and         ¸treacherous to even attempt at crossing through them. The only relatively safe access to the Forgotten Valley is by a river that runs through the Scales Swamps and connects the two areas. However, with the Scales Swamps being very dangerous, no one has   ¸ever attempted such a journey. Thus, the valley of rainforest eventually acquired the name of 'Forgotten Valley', since civilizations are aware of it but have 'forgot' about the idea of attempting to explore it, let alone settle it. Of course, not much   ˛is known of this place, except for what tall tales and wild stories try to convey. Hence, folklore of the area has it that the valley is inhabited by lizard-like monsters, fearsome flying serpents, giant snakes and evil crocodiles. Other stories speak of ˜cannibal savages, blood-thirsty catmen and degenerate snakemen. However, there is a legend that is intriguing: apparently, a secret city of the lost Lankharhan empire is said to lie deep within the Forgotten Valley. But that remains to be proven."        ˝"The elven forest-kingdom of Lorill is almost four thousand years old. Although these elves are peaceful, they are quite defensive of their borders. Thus, they allow passage into their kingdom only to trade caravans or to people accompanied by a subject  ¯of the kingdom. Not even other elves are allowed, unless escorted by a native of Lorill. On the other hand, elves from Lorill often wander about outside of their kingdom. In any case, Lorill trades actively with Seacrest, Calember and the gnomes of       ÛGoldylock, but remain fierce isolationists. This is probably due to the fact that their forest-kingdom is bordered to the north by the Scales Swamps and is often plagued by raids from trolls: not wishing to leave themselves open to invasion by            ˆhumans lords and kings, they prefer to close their borders as prevention. Indeed, although peace and prosperity reigns today between Lorill and its human neighbors, some of the older monarchs of Seacrest attempted to conquer the elves in the past         …- and thus Lorill remains extremely wary to this day, knowing that the succeeding short lives of humans are all too often harbingers of quick changes in disposition and goodwill towards their kingdom."                                                      ˚"Librunae is a local folklore hero of note. This good witch was shunned most of her life by folks, ignorance and fear overlooking her good principles and devotion to help others. Ten years ago, the black dragon known as 'Black Kiss' began to terrorize    ıthe area, attacking caravans and hunting cattle and folks for food. The good witch Librunae confronted Black Kiss and fought the dragon single-handedly, using her great knowledge and powers of magic. After a long and fierce battle that decimated          ˚her house and destroyed the woods surrounding it, a dying Librunae broke one of her rings of wizardry to unleash its potent magical energies in one terrible -and final- assault. But the witch's sacrifice was in vain, for Black Kiss was brought to near    ıdeath, but was not killed. Thus, Librunae's body was completely destroyed in that final attack of hers, while Black Kiss managed to fly slowly away to heal. Although the dragon has not been seen since then, many fear her impending return. As for          ˚Librunae, many a tale speak of her soul still wandering about the ruins of her house. Some folks even say that if you stand in the ruins of her abode and speak her name, the witch will appear in her ghostly form. But this is obviously local folklore."    ˙"Rumor has it that the crazy druid Chlorophus is lying low in the old Watchtower in the swamps, just north of here. He once tried to conquer the Seacrest area with an army of earth creatures, but was driven out by adventurers. He is a dangerous man."     ¯"It is rumored that Aztranak, a powerful lich of old, made his crypt centuries ago on a small island in the Scales Swamps. Aztranak once ruled over almost all of the Azure Coast, until he retired with his treasure into his heavily-protected crypt."       ˘"In its rise as a competitor against Seacrest, Calember is seeking to enlist Edgemoor within its sphere of influence. While this results in diplomatic tensions between Seacrest and Calember, active trade and relations remain between the two cities."      ˆ"It is said that the Island-Nation of Umaldyr, which lies far to the northeast of here, is greatly benefiting from the rise of trade between Anarym and the far-away continent of Realmz.

In the meantime, I was to find the Tiara   ˙of the Lost Highkings, a relic holy to my people which would help me challenge our corrupted Highking. The Tiara was lost hundreds of summer solstices ago, when the evil dragon Death Emerald attacked our city. I have found the lair of Death Emerald!"     ›He smiles with grim determination.

Smiling warmly, the old priest inclines his head to you:            ˝"Ever since the snake-men came to our city and corrupted the Highking, all of the priesthood of the Wise Serpent were forced to flee into exile, hoping to return one day and deliver our people from the Dark Snake. You have our most heartfelt gratitude."  ˘He bows his head again. Gently taking the Tiara from you, the old priest places it upon Tecoltitan's head: "As we set ourselves to make things right with our God, we need a noble leader that is pure of heart and rich in wisdom. The Feathered Serpent      Úhas chosen Tecoltitan!" After placing the Tiara on Tecoltitan's head, the old priest turns to his people: "He is deserving to walk in Turoac's footsteps! Let us all hail our new Highking!" At that, the mayaltecs rise and cheer aloud with joy.             ¯"With the snake-men gone," Tecoltitan announces to his people, "now is the time to make peace with our neighbors, the Cat People. Together, we will be ever vigilant and strong should the snake-men decide to return in our midst!" More cheers follow.       "Me goes bring news to me people!" An excited Mrrysh exclaims. After embracing is friend Tecoltitan, he turns to you: "You brave people! Me is proud to fight alongside you! Maybe we meet again, someday." After final partings, Mrrysh leaves.               ÌAs the mayaltecs rush to Tecoltitan to raise him onto their shoulders in celebration, you quietly slip away to mend your wounds and recuperate.

Once it is completed, then I will have to dwell there since I am the Highking." He then chuckles. "But I'm afraid it won't be completed soon - we build slowly but strongly, so it could take a couple of years!"            ¸He then gives you a map.

At the foot of the ziggurat's steps stand numerous psi-warriors, all lined up in formation and prepared to do battle. Obviously, you were expected ...       ˝An armor-clad woman standing behind the line of psi-warriors calls you out: "On behalf of Consul Yavis Shuul, Ninth Speaker," she motions to the hooded man standing next to her, "and myself, Praetor Varlys Qui and Second Speaker, I bid you all welcome!"  ¬You can't help but wince at the mention of this woman's name, for you remember well another warrior-woman of the Inner Council of the Overlords who also bore the name of 'Qui': General Arla Qui.                                                             Ù"As you have guessed," Praetor Qui continues with a cruel smile, "we two are the last Speakers of the Inner Council of Overlords. Last, that is, not counting our esteemed First Speaker, the High Praetor Primus Ankh." She lets out a dry chuckle.           ı"He did warn us about your annoying stubborness and that you would likely show up in Lankh'Nar, sooner or later. We hoped Commander Sura would be competent enough to neutralize you in Seacrest - but your presence here means that she failed us."           ‚"Enough of this nonsense!" Oberon intervenes, glaring angrily at the two Overlords. "Don't you realize the abomination that Primus Ankh is seeking to unleash? Don't you know that he hosts the essence of the dreaded Hierarch?"                              ˆ"Of course we do, traitor." Consul Yavis Shuul replies smugly. "Yes: I call you a traitor. As one of our kin, you should be standing with us, instead of against us and on the side of these filthy, degenerate mongrels!" Praetor Qui smiles at that.         ˘"We may be kin," Oberon replies with disdain, "but truly you are fools to believe that you are superior to non-psionic races. You are even bigger fools if you believe that the Mentarchs will show you any special consideration. For in their mad eyes,      7all of us are nothing but fodder for their evil whims!"

Consul Yavis Shuul nods firmly in agreement.                          a"In addition", Qui adds between clenched teeth, "I finally get to avenge my younger sister Arla!"                                                                                                                                                              9At that, the two Overlords and their psi-warriors attack!                                                                                                                                                                                                      _"I must admit," Oberon mumbles, panting and tired, "I am getting a bit too old for such sport!"

The main hall you find yourselves in has numerous library shelves, with each shelf filled with books. A quick survey tells you that these books are scientific and technomagic treatises.      ßAlthough the place seems as quiet as a tomb, you know that Primus/Maximus, and perhaps even the Mentarchs brought back from the past, are lurking around ... somewhere.                                                                                        `A small pool of continually flowing water is here. It adds a nice decorative touch to the place.                                                                                                                                                               ûThis place is a large laboratory. Jars, vials and containers of all sorts of strange concoctions and elixirs are strewn about on the floor and on work tables.                                                                                                 ÏThis ancient slab of solid obsidian serves as a landmark of some sort. Etched onto the slab are decorative bas-reliefs as well as the following: "THE LANKH'NAR NEW DAWN PROJECT: THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF THE EMPIRE OF LANKHARH BEGAN HERE".                   πThe sides of the slab are in turn etched with the names of various men and women, each one with lofty titles such as "Master Technomancer", "Master Technician", "Master Alchemist", etc.                                                                      Ï"Glorious future indeed." Oberon mumbles sarcastically. "They created the Mentarchs and their very creations brought about the fall of the empire they sought to secure. What were those fools thinking?" He sighs with resignation at that.                   “Upon closer inspection, you notice that one of the decorative bas-reliefs of the obsidian slab can be depressed. After pushing on it, a segment of the wall behind the slab sinks into the floor to reveal a door!                                             ˚You find in this room strange cylinders of glass set into what appears to be machines. Most of the cylinders are empty or broken, while the machines they are set into are lifeless. However, four of these cylinders are filled with some bubbling liquid.    fFurthermore, the machines they are set into are alive with humming and blinking lights of many colors.                                                                                                                                                         ı"In the name of Quanthaas!" Oberon exclaims. He is as white as ghost, his face contorted by dread and fear. "The worst possible nightmare! Primus/Maximus is trying to generate new Mentarch bodies to be used as hosts, in these active incubators!"          ˚You wonder aloud why he would go through the trouble, since all the Mentarchs need are human hosts, preferably ones gifted with psionic powers. Oberon shakes his head vigorously at that: "Remember that the Mentarchs were long-lived! Not only are their    ˝essences nearly immortal as long as they are hosted, but their physical bodies could last for a thousand year, if not more! Primus/Maximus not only wants to bring back the reign of the Mind Lords, but he also wants himself and his siblings to be whole!"  ÙYou then cast a suspicious glance in Strider's direction. Seeing that, he throws up his hands in helpless surrender: "Now wait here!" He intones, almost ruefully. "Yes, I *am* long-lived and I *do* have mental powers, but I'm *not* a Mentarch!"           ˙"I was born a normal human who happened to have somehow inherited psionic powers. My long-life is magical in nature since, as I told you already, I fell into a vat filled with some sort of longevity potion made by a dark wizard I had just destroyed!"     âKnowing that Strider speaks the truth, you nonetheless pretend to still harbor suspicions about him - just to rattle his chains a little.                                                                                                                      GTo your satisfaction, you see Galduur fighting hard not laugh out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                        r"Let us not waste any time!"

"We have to destroy those active incubators!"                                                                                                                                             ¿You notice that a small mass of living tissue is floating within the liquid of this container. Blebbling and contorting, it seems to be alive ... and growing.

As all of the cylinder's contents spill on the cold floor, the living mass of tissue undergoes death spasms while the machine of the cylinder shuts down.                                             ¿Primus Ankh stands defiant before you. It is with much surprise that you find him flanked by Varlys Qui and Yavis Shuul, who seem rather healthy despite the fact that you killed them earlier.                                                                qOnly then you notice in the back of the room a vortex of shimmering flames swirling and twisting above the floor.                                                                                                                                              ˆ"While you were busy destroying his holy work," Primus snarls, "our Omniscience the Hierarch left my body and returned to his abode in the Astral Plane, taking with him the revered Mentarchs he rescued from the past." He chuckles coldly at that.          ˙"At the same time, I revived my collegues, Varlys and Yavis, then simply waited for you. Once we are done with you mongrels, I'll then stabilize my dimensional machine and give the good news to our revered Hierarch, so that he may return once more."      Í"How could mites like you have succeeded time and again at foiling me, then we the Overlords, and even our revered Hierarch? Well, it doesn't matter anymore: now, *finally*, I get my chance to personally destroy you once and for all!"                     At that, the fight is on!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ˙Primus then explodes with anger: "How dare you? How dare you intervene in the grandest plan of them all? We were so close to bring about the Second Rising in the past! And now, here, yet again you seek to prevent us from achieving our holy endeavor!"     tPanting and tired, you set yourself to examine the strange vortex floating above the floor at the back of this room.                                                                                                                                           SPrimus' dimensional machine lies still, power-depleted and probably broken as well.                                                                                                                                                                            ıThe vortex of shimmering flames still swirls wildly above the floor. You notice that its size fluctuates greatly, as if being unstable: chances are that Primus' dimensional machine which created this hole to the Astral Plane will soon breakdown.          ùKnowing that going through the vortex is almost assuredly a one-way trip, do you jump into the vortex to follow Maximus and his siblings in the Astral Plane?                                                                                                  Ú"The Mind Lords must be destroyed once and for all, even if hunting them down in the Astral Plane means that maybe we'll never come home. But if we don't try, what will prevent Maximus from finding another host and seek to return once again?"             ÈHe shakes his head at that. "Whether it takes a week, a year or thousands of years, Maximus will try again - that is for certain. So, if you do not go, then I will - even if alone!" Without further due, Strider jumps into the vortex!                      M"Wait fer me, ye crazy fool!" Galduur yells out, before following his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                  Ω"I must fulfill my duty to the Eternal One." Lindanyl announces. "With or without you, I must attempt to destroy the Mentarchs once and for all."

One thing I do know: one day, the Mind Lords will again return to threaten all of us."                          ±Sighing, he extends his hand to shake yours: "Thus I bid you here goodbye, as well as safe journeys and safer returns." Without another word, Oberon weaves a spell and vanishes.                                                                              ‰"Well, it's been fun!" Galduur mumbles as he shakes your hand. "But me got some Mind Lord huntin' to do, ye know? An' me don't care where the huntin' ground be!" With a final salute with his axe, Galduur goes through the vortex.                           |Soon enough, Primus' machine runs out of power, shutting down the vortex and your only known mean to go to the Astral Plane.                                                                                                                                   πGazing blankly at the now lifeless machine, you wonder if you made the right decision by not going to the Astral Plane, and attempt to destroy Maximus and his siblings once and for all.                                                                      ¯With a shrug, you push away those questions.

But suddenly, all your senses come back to you as you find yourself standing in the middle of a very eerie place!                                                      ˝You find Primus Ankh in this room, guarded by his personal lieutenants. Upon your entrance, he calmly rises from his bed -as if expecting you. Only then do you notice three glowing globes set in the back of the room -the essences of the other mentarchs.  Í"Greetings, fools." Primus/Maximus snarls with his otherworldly voice. "Yes, it is I, Maximus, who is speaking to you. It seems our meetings are often oh-so-fleeting: for once again, I will depart shortly." He adds with a dry chuckle.                     ¯He then glares at Oberon: "I recognize the symbol that you are wearing." He intones, pointing to the hourglass embroidered upon Oberon's robe. "Now I understand much of what has transpired. A traitor *and* and Time Master. Yes." He nods to himself.       kA machine suddenly activates, opening a vortex of shimmering flames, swirling and twisting above the floor.                                                                                                                                                    RWordlessly, Primus/Maximus then calmly turns his gaze to the far back of the room.                                                                                                                                                                             gPrimus then screams, his body convulsing violently. At the same time, he is bathed in a blinding light.                                                                                                                                                        ÍYour are then face to face with the essence of Maximus. Casting an angry glare at you, he floats to the back of the room: "TAKE CARE OF THIS NUISANCE!" You hear him order Primus, as he lifts the essence-orbs and jumps into the vortex!                     ›A fully recovered Primus snarls: "Our Omniscience the Hierarch just left my body and returned to his abode in the Astral Plane, taking with him the revered Mentarchs he rescued from the past." He chuckles coldly at that.                                   Í"I, along with my personal aides, are to prevent you from following him. Once we are done with you mongrels, I'll then stabilize my dimensional machine and give the good news to our revered Hierarch, so that he may return once more."                      4Primus Ankh's personal fortune is now yours to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                           ˛Chuckling, you manage to get a word in edgewise and tell them that you have taken care of the problem concerning the bandits and marauders, by defeating the electromancer Stygiax and his conspirators. "Me be impressed!" Galduur grunts. "Aye!" Raack adds. îThe ranger then shrugs: "Well, I'm sure we'll find some other mischief for us to do together, in the meantime!" Both he and Galduur chuckle at that.                                                                                                           ãYou decide that perhaps you should investigate the monolith at the next opportunity that you get - that is, once you are done with Stygiax.                                                                                                                    4Yavis Shuul's personal fortune is now yours to take!                                                                                                                                                                                                           +Varlys Qui's personal fortune is now yours!                                                                                                                                                                                                                    `This strange diagram etched permanently into the psionic matter here pulses with powerful magic.                                                                                                                                                               ˝You are suddenly enveloped in a shroud of psionic energies!

"What an extraordinary feat!"        ÔHe laughs with excitement. "Truly, you are more than heroes! Knowing that, had Maximus or any other of his siblings remained safely back in the Astral Plane, then the menace of the Mind Lords would most certainly have eventually returned!"                ˛He then sighs. "I must admit that all of this adventuring and excitement makes me long for the comforts of the Hourglass Tower. I *am* a scholar after all!" He adds, with a wink. "I bid you all safe journeys and safer returns! Perhaps, one of these days, {we shall meet again! I sincerely hope so, Quanthaas willing!"

But now I must take my leave, for I find myself back  ˝on the continent of my birth and I wish to revisit my old stomping grounds - the city of Southgate, to be precise. Who knows? If you decide to explore more of Anarym, the Fates will surely make our paths cross again!" He shakes your hand warmly at that.  ^With final partings and well-wishes, Strider whips up a rod of teleportation and activates it.                                                                                                                                                                 ˜Lindanyl comes up to you and gives you a warm embrace.

She sighs.        ‡"Then I will have to journey anew, as I must travel far up north to the Great Citadel of Quanthaas and give a full account as well to the High Council of my priesthood. Whether we meet again or not, I will never forget you!"                               >With final goodbyes, Lindanyl weaves a spell of teleportation.

She bows her head at that:                          û"It is an honor to have known you and to have journeyed with you all." Without further due, the ever-aloof Starrune weaves a spell and teleports herself away.                                                                                                 ˘"Well, me dunno about ye, but me sure longs fer some good drinks, eh?"

But of course, first we must find a good inn to rest!"    3You nod at his suggestion, laughing along with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                            ˙"Well, that was -um- interesting!" Nerylka muses with a mischievous smile. "Truly, I still can't believe we managed to pull it off! So, what's next for us?" Before you can answer, she waves her hand in warding: "No, no, no! First, I need a good meal,     µa good drink *and* a good bath! *Then* you can tell me where else you think we should go to risk our lives and limbs!" She then laughs out loud at that; you can't help but join her.                                                                          ¯"Now that we've tried our hand at destroying God-like beings, I suggest that we find ourselves an actual God and slay him!"

Sitting on a throne is a creature -an abomination- that is half-woman and half-snake, with snake-like hairs moving and writhing sickeningly about her head. She flicks a forked tongue      ˙at you, her reptilian eyes glaring with evil and hatred. All about her are snakes of many species, gliding and twisting in contentment at being near her - in fact, a mammoth snake is wrapped protectively around her, affectionately flicking its tongue     Ôin her direction. "I was expecting you." The ssethanti Queen announces with a hiss. "Your impending arrival was foretold to me by those that my people were originally created to serve." She chuckles - or rather, gurgles- at your confusion.                ı"We were created a long time ago by the lankharhans of old. We were perfect humans, designed with enhanced capacities for endurance and adaptation. But not long after the fall of the Lankharhan empire, this perfection in us proved to be a flaw."          ¸She hisses again. "Left on our own to live in this jungle, our design-enhanced adaptive capabilities caused us to mutate to mimic the attributes of reptiles, the best suited to survive in such an environment. Only us Queens have ever known this truth."   ¯She then flicks her tongue in the air. "But our people were at a loss, so the Cult of Sseth was instituted to keep them under control and give them pride. Thus, my people do not know our true purpose, which is to watch over the ruins of Lankh'Nar."       ˛She then slithers to the south wall, where a strange machine is obviously activated, humming and crackling with energy. "And to guard the Nexus Source," the Queen adds, "which generates a shield over what is called the Forbidden City, in order to prevent ¸anything from despoiling it. Anything, that is, but those endowed with mental powers like our creators of old." She chuckles anew. "Of course, to my people, the Nexus Source is a holy relic from Sseth, which can be looked upon only by Queens, like me."   ˝The ssethanti slithers back to her throne. "Likewise, queens like me are worshiped by my people as being blessed by the Mighty Serpent Sseth - and so is this ziggurat holy and sacred to them." She take a deep, hissing breath at that. "But enough of this  ºchatter. It is time for me to honor the word of my ancestors, if only in gratitude for my race having been given life by the lankharhans!" At that, the ssethanti Queen and her pets attack!                                                                   ∂"My people ..." The dying queen hisses. "They will be lost ... without a queen ...

Energy is somehow produced at the tip of the spires; these sparks of energy coalesce into a crystal-shaped lattice which seems to  ˛float above the machine. In turn, the lattice discharges pulses of energy to the ceiling: looking up, you see that these pulses are aimed at a metallic spike set into the ceiling. You then realize that this spike is the bottom end of the tall, pulsating  Øspire that you saw atop the ziggurat when you entered it. Looking back down, you notice on the machine two sets of square colored panels: one on the right and one on the left.

Surprisingly, the castle appears to be made up of one large hall filled with sparkling columns of marble,                      ßits ceiling seemingly reaching as high as you can see. Although you do not spot any torches or lanterns, this strange hall is bathed with an ambient soft, white light.                                                                                        ¸"Welcome to my abode." A booming voice intones. Ahead of you, further down the hall, you see three Mind Lord essences floating soundlessly above the floor.

"So, the end-game is upon us at last!" Intones the Mentarch in the middle; by his voice, you recognize him as Maximus. "As you can see, our essences can be ˙free of the need for a corporeal body almost indefinitely, as long as we remain here on the Astral Plane." Maximus continues, quite smug. "That is how I managed to last for thousands of years without a host. Nonetheless, I was quite happy when Primus     ¸contacted me, after finding Lankh'Nar and the dimensional machine I myself used to escape here in the first place. That was ten years ago." He pauses at that, then chuckles. "A very short time, granted. But for beings such as we, time is meaningless as   ˝long as we remain here. I shall miss Primus, for he was a very loyal lackey. But there will be other opportunities for us to reclaim our birthright as Ruling Gods of Lhari-Orin, for time is on our side." In unisson, the three Mentarchs chuckle wickedly.  ¸"This is where you err, Maximus!" Oberon intejects, his eyes glaring with determination. "We have come here to put an end to your existence, to rid the world of your menace once and for all! You who believe that might makes right, that power grants you   Ùsuperiority, will finally learn the truth: only wisdom and compassion make right! This truth the Noble Three -Kith Khanaan, Umma Porogrove and Shalym Relimanab- did always understand. That is why they sought initially to save you from madness!"           ˝"These names are not to be mentioned in my presence! How dare you address me, traitor to your race!" Maximus roars, his essence glowing with anger and hatred. "My race?" An indignant Oberon replies. "See my point? Whether you like it or not, lankharhans  ˘created you, using lankharhan tissues and bodies! They were irresponsible in trying to create the highest advanced lankharhans possible, but at least they were naively well intentioned. The Noble Three always understood that the Mentarchs were meant      ˜to be *lankharhans* first, enlightened teachers second, and kind rulers third. But your ilk selfishly rejected this basic truth of your creation. Instead, you chose in your arrogance to become the worst of racists - even to your own, true, blood!"        ¯"Be that as it may," a suddenly aloof Maximus interjects, "upon my return here, I have sensed that a mage has settled in the Astral Plane - and relatively near my abode at that. This means that she has the knowledge to travel the Planes and thus is       ˘possessed of great power. Herein lies my new plan to bring about our Second Rising: although this mage may not be of lankharhan descent, she will be quite suitable nonetheless as a host for me! Indeed, she will allow me to travel the Planes easily!"      FYou then realize that the mad Hierarch is talking about the Sceptanar!                                                                                                                                                                                         ˜Maximus continues in earnest, turning to his two remaining siblings: "So harken, Nuul Zarrakian and Azure Malachys! We will yet succeed, provided that we rid ourselves of these dangerous individuals! Remember that they destroyed Uther and Sappho!"        ¥"Now it is their turn!" The Mentarch Nuul intones with a snarl. "Indeed." Adds the Mentarch Azure. "They will pay for their heresy and defiance!" At that, the two Mentarchs attack!                                                                           ˚Maximus bellows with laughter. "No more must I, the Hierarch, burden myself with any of my lesser siblings. They have served their purpose to weaken you, so that I may deliver the final blow and send you to the netherworld were filth like you belong!"    Ò"From now on, only I alone will rule the world like a God." Maximus adds. " This is my birthright, my destiny!"
