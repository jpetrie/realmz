Half Truth, a scenario designed for the Realmz game engine by TremordredYou need to possess a registered version of Realmz to play Half Truth.  Realmz was created by Tim Philips and is owned by Fantasoft LLC. He can be reached at www.fantasoft.com.Introduction:There is no background for this scenario. You arrive in a strange land knowing nothing.It is up to you to survive and flourish in this place.Style:You will come across some unusual words, place names, and expressions in the scenario. Most of these are Cornish, some are Welsh and some Irish. I will produce a language guide to accompany the scenario in the coming months for those with an interest in Celtic lore and language.One general note: you emphasise the second syllable in Cornish words: e.g.TreMORdred, PorthENys, GoDOLphin etcThe lead syllable is very soft and quick.Acknowledgements:My beta testing team did a superb job of helping me track down and eliminate bugs and typos.They are:Isaac CharonSkip MeierDavid LavenderHamlin KrewsonMatt EdwardsDarrell ZaneskiMartin StackJason ShoreMany people on the Divinity Guild who answered questions and shared their thoughts.I used three CiCNs from Flabio the Mage's DRM Icon collection for which I thank and credit him.Registration:For registration or problems with registration codes email: Fantasoft1@aol.comContact:For everything else, email the author: Tremorded at ntt@the-wire.com.Legalese:The scenario 'Half Truth' is Copyright 2000 Nicholas Tyacke and Fantasoft LLC.I created a great deal of sounds and icons during the making of Half Truth.
